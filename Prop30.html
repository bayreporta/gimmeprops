						<p>This is the ultimate tax battle. <strong><b>Governor Jerry Brown</b></strong> and <strong><b>Millionaire Molly Munger</b></strong> both have competing plans on how to tax Californians and best spend that money -- <strong><b>Prop 30</b></strong> and <strong><b>Prop 38 respectively</b></strong>. With so many similarities between the two, what makes them different? Enter Tax Fighter. </p></br>

									<h1>Pay If You Buy</h1>
									<p>Prop 30 would raises the sales tax a quarter-of-a-percent to 7.50 percent until the 2016-2017 fiscal year. That means for every $100 dollars you spend, an extra quarter would be tacked on to the tax you already pay when buying something.</p>
								</div>
								<div id="bv2" class="explain explain2">
									<h1>K to CC</h1>
									<p>Billions of dollars would be made available for education. The breakdown: 89 percent of tax revenue would go to K-12 education. The other 11 percent would go to community colleges. The amount schools and colleges get is based on how many students there are enrolled. </p>
								</div>
								<div id="bv3" class="explain explain3">
									<h1>Budgetpocalpyse</h1>
									<p>Governor Jerry Brown built into the 2012-2013 budget an automatic $5.9 billion spending cut that would be triggered if Prop 30 fails. The vast majority of that cut would go to K-12 education and community colleges. Also included, public universities and CalFire.</p>
								</div>
								<div id="bv4" class="explain explain4">
									<h1>$6 Billion Plan</h1>
									<p>Californians who make more than $250,000 a year would pay anywhere between one to three percent more on their personal income taxes until fiscal year 2018-2019. This the additional income and sales tax and revenue combined would bring in an estimated $6 billion each year. </p>

									<h1>Grants for Kids</h1>
									<p>Money for K-12 would be dished out to schools in the form of grants. So 70 percent of new tax revenue would be doled out based on school population, 18 percent based on the number of low-income students at the school, and 12 percent in order to upgrade technology and teaching materials. </p>
								</div>
								<div id="mv2" class="explain explain2">
									<h1>Get 'em Early</h1>
									<p>A portion of tax revenue would go toward ECE programs, including expanding preschool for low-income families, restoring previous budget reductions to ECE programs, creating a Head Start for low-income families, and to pay state subsidized early care and education programs. </p>
								</div>
								<div id="mv3" class="explain explain3">
									<h1>Pay Your Debts</h1>
									<p>Up until the 2016-17 budget year, 30 percent of tax revenue would go to paying off state debt. Education debt costs for school facilities will be the priority, then any remaining funds would go to any other bond debts. There will be a growth limit on money for schools and ECE, so after 2016, whatever is left over will go to debt service. </p>
								</div>
								<div id="mv4" class="explain explain4">
									<h1>$10b Plan</h1>
									<p>All but the poorest Californians would have their personal income taxes raised until fiscal year 2024-2025. The new taxes would raise an estimated $10 billion on average each year, which could increase over time. In the first four years, the money would go to K-12 education (60 percent), Debt Service (30 percent), and Early Care and Education (10 percent). </p>

									<h1>Slash, Not Tax</h1>
									<p>Conservatives tend to argue that budgetary problems are due to government spending more money than it can afford. Their solution is to cut spending, rather than raise tax revenue. This line of thought is directly opposite of both propositions. </p>
								</div>
								<div id="nv2" class="explain explain2">
									<h1>Sign the Pledge</h1>
									<p>Join the Republican party in signing Grover Norquist’s Taxpayer Protection Pledge, in which politicians promise to not raise income taxes on individuals or businesses. It also pledges to decrease tax deductions and credits unless there are equal spending cuts. Sorry, props 30 and 38. </p>
								</div>
								<div id="nv3" class="explain explain4">
									<h1>Do Your Jobs</h1>
									<p>A number of government observers and experts have argued that ballot-box budgeting, a pejorative term used to describe using the initiative process for budget matters, has caused many of California’s fiscal problems. the line of thought is that Sacramento should deal with the budget, not voters. </p>
