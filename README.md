Gimme Props!
==========

This was a project seven UC Berkeley Journalism Graduate Students completed during the 2012 elections. The goal was to distill the complexity of ballot measures into something more fun and accessible. What was born was Gimme Props!

The project was built using JavaScript, jQuery, Leaflet, and Modernizr. The slide-based mechanic of the project has been exported for use by anyone who may find use for it. You can <a href="https://github.com/bayreporta/explainr">find it here</a>.
